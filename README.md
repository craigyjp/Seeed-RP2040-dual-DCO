# Seeed-RP2040-dual-DCO
A single voice dual DCO with the Seeed XIAO RP2040

Carrying on the excellent work by Jan Knipper.

I ported his Polykit Pico DCO to the Seeed XIAO RP2040, not much of a feat I know, but I made a single voice dual DCO with the available pins. 
I modded the detune so only the second DCO actually detuned down from the first. 
I also added the FM input and control input both +/-5v input range. Gate output 0-3.3v as before, could be level shifted if needed.

The stack has gone as itâ€™s now a permanent 2 DCO voice. Each wave has its own VCA so it can be mixed by voltage control or a control knob. 
There is an octave select for -1/0/+1 octave adjustment. input is by Din MIDI or USBmidi as before. 
Really a Pico could have been used, but I bought half a dozen of these modules and wanted to try to use them.
